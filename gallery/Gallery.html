                    <h1>History of International Women's Day</h1>
                    <p>The history of International Women's Day dates back to the early 20th century when women around the world were fighting for equal rights and freedom.
                         On March 8th, 1908, more than 15,000 women in the United States marched in New York, demanding shorter working hours, higher wages, and equality with men.
                          This was a significant event in the campaign for women's suffrage.</p>
                    <p>Then, in 1910, at the International Women's Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, March 8th was chosen as the International Women's Day to honor women's achievements 
                        and raise awareness of women's rights. Since then, this day has become an occasion to celebrate and show respect for women worldwide.</p>
                    <p>International Women's Day has become an important day to highlight issues related to women, including gender equality, employment, education, health, and family life.
                         It is also an opportunity to honor the achievements of women in various fields and express gratitude to the women who have made a difference in our lives.</p>
                    <p>Since 1977, the United Nations has officially recognized International Women's Day as an international holiday. Each year,
                         International Women's Day is celebrated with activities, events, and campaigns to honor and promote women's rights worldwide.</p>
